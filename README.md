# unity-steering-lib
A collection of ready-made Steering Behaviours for Unity games. 
The library includes components to add to your game objects to add steering functionality. In addition, the steering movement module can be used in isolation for other systems, such as animating UI elements.

## Features
- Flexibility: Steering agents can switch behaviours anytime with no added overhead or setup required. Just changing the current flag is all you need, and it will seamlessly follow the new steering behaviour.
- Performance: No runtime instantiation or destruction when running or changing behaviours. In the same way, it's not necessary to add, remove or switch Unity components at runtime.
- Extensibility: New steering behaviours can be easily added without modifying the library.

## Usage and license
While I'm mostly using this for internal development, you're more than welcome to use this in your Unity project, following the conditions and limitations specified in the LICENSE. Also, while not necessary, please make sure to credit me and help spread this library.
